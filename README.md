# VideoGame

This is a project for the development of a shooting range. Here we aim to replicate a military training field, similar to those in well-known games like Call of Duty.

By using the following link, you will be directed to a video on how to install the Assimp library in your Visual Studio for loading 3D models. Using the provided code will result in a camera similar to that of a modern first-person shooter game.
