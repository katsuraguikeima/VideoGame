## VideoGame

- This is a project that aims to replicate or simulate a first-person shooter game in OpenGL using different libraries and 3D models for its development.
- In this project, we use OpenGL because it is not widely used today for the creation of games or 3D virtual tours, which is understandable since there are other more used, optimized, and easier-to-use options.
- Currently, this project has been a challenge for the involved team members since none of us had used this technology before, which was a disadvantage in that sense.
- In this project, we are using the following libraries: 
1. GLFW
2. stbimage
3. glad
4. json
5. glm
6. SFLM

among others. This repository contains the libraries used in the project.

Project Preparation 
=============
For the project preparation, we have this video which, is short but explanatory on how we will install our libraries and configure our directories.

[Video in youtube ](https://youtu.be/TOPvFvL_GRY?si=_erA--F7_AyNiBX7)

Some of the things we must consider for these configurations are that the project is made in Visual Studio 2019, and if you use a different version, we cannot guarantee it will run correctly. Therefore, we recommend using Visual Studio 2019.

To better understand this project in its final phase, you can find the completed project in the targetPractice folder. To execute it correctly, you should open the file named TargetPractice.sln, and on the right side, in the header files, there is one named main.cpp. Double-click it to open the code, and then run it from main.cpp.

many times we did not find the errors or we did not find solutions to those errors, that gave rise to us to consider taking what we planned elsewhere

Example: Originally we were going to use the Assimp library but due to some problems we moved to the current one 

I know that this read me is not very explanatory but do not stay with what is written here not always the read me will be the one that unravels all the errors we say it from experience we hope it has a good day, afternoon, night
